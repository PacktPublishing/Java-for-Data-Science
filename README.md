# Java for Data Science
This is the code repository for [Java for Data Science](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/java-data-science?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785280115), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:

In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds
of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text are shown as follows: “The getResultmethod returns a
SpeechResultinstance which holds the result of the processing." Database table names,
folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter
handles are shown as follows: "The KevinVoiceDirectorycontains two voices: kevin
and kevin16."
A block of code is set as follows:
```
Voice[] voices = voiceManager.getVoices();
for (Voice v : voices) {
out.println(v);
}
Any command-line input or output is written as follows:
Name: kevin16
Description: default 16-bit diphone voice
Organization: cmu
Age: YOUNGER_ADULT
Gender: MALE
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for
example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Select the Imagescategory
and then filter for Labeled for reuse.
```

Many of the examples in the book use Java 8 features. There are a number of Java APIs demonstrated, each of which is introduced before it is applied. An IDE is not required but is desirable.
